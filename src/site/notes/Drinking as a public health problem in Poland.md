## Alcohol consumption

### Advertising

- US

	- Annotations - Saffer and Dave, “Alcohol Advertising and Alcohol Consumption by Adolescents.”
	
		- “Price and advertising effects are generally larger for females relative to males” 
		
		- “Results from the NLSY97 suggest that a 28% reduction in alcohol advertising would reduce adolescent monthly alcohol participation from 25% to between 24 and 21%” 
		
		- “For binge participation, the reduction would be from 12% to between 11 and 8%” 
		
		- “The past month price participation elasticity is estimated at 0.26, consistent with prior studies.” 
		
		- “effects may vary by race and gender” 
		
		- “For past month and binge participation, the magnitudes are 0.26 and 0.18,” 

- EU

	- Annotations - de Bruijn et al., “European Longitudinal Study on the Relationship between Adolescents’ Alcohol Marketing Exposure and Alcohol Use.”
	
		- “School-based sample in 181 state-funded schools in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland.” 
		
		- “(mean age 14 years, 49.5% male.” 
		
		- “The analyses showed one-directional long-term effects of alcohol marketing exposure on drinking” 
		
		- “There appears to be a one-way effect of alcohol marketing exposure on adolescents’ alcohol use over time, which cannot be explained by either previous drinking or exposure to nonalcohol-branded marketing.” 
		
		- “Frequency of recent alcohol use was established by asking respondents at T1, T2 and T3: ‘On how many occasions (if any) have you had any alcoholic beverage to drink during the last 30 days?’” 
		
		- “We considered alcohol marketing exposure as a latent variable [35], indicated by 13 alcohol marketing items measuring exposure to online alcohol marketing, televised alcohol advertising, alcohol sport sponsorship, music event/festival sponsorship, ownership of alcohol-branded promotional items and reception of free samples and exposure to price offers” 
		
		- “‘On a usual school day (Monday to Friday) how much hours do you spend using the internet?’.” 
		
		- “Frequency of exposure to non-alcohol sponsored football championships was included, and was similar to the measure of exposure to alcohol-sponsored football championships.” 
		
		- “exposure to non-alcohol-branded television programmes and internet use did not increase the fit of the model and were excluded from the final model.” 
		
		- “Examination of the parameter estimates showed that the effect of alcohol marketing exposure at T1 to frequency of past-month drinking at T2 was statistically significant [estimate = 0.420; standard error (SE) = 0.058; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.324 – 0.515; P < 0.001, standardized estimate = 0.140].” 
		
		- “drinking at T1 and T2 to alcohol marketing exposure at T2 and T3, respectively, was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).” 
		
		- “Our findings suggest that when considering the reciprocal process between alcohol marketing exposure and alcohol use at each timepoint, there remains a one-way effect of alcohol marketing exposure on adolescents’ alcohol use over time” 
		
		- “When taking into account the impact of alcoholbranded media exposure, we found non-alcohol-branded media exposure not to be associated with adolescents’ drinking.” 
		
		- “We examined the causal order of alcohol marketing exposure and drinking using an autoregressive crosslagged model, which is seen as an appropriate method”

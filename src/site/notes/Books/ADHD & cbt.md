# Adhd & CBT

## Problem solving
- The central skill involved when reaching out for help is to handle the discomfort associated with initiating contact, which is an emotional regulation skill.
	1. As with facing other difficult tasks, a first step is ==defining in specific and behavioral terms what you need to do==, shrinking it down to its core elements
		- (e.g., “I need to contact my professor and explain the situation.”)
	2. A second step is to ==challenge the what-if thoughts and worst-case scenarios that interfere with taking action== (e.g., “What if my professor is angry with me?” or “I will be kicked out of college and my parents will never forgive me.”). Although your concerns are possible, your Defense Attorney can help you to develop a more realistic outlook about facing the situation
		- (e.g., “This is not the first time my professor has dealt with a student who did not hand in an assignment. She might respect that I reached out to her.” Or, “I might have to retake the course, but I probably will not be kicked out. My parents will probably be upset, but it is better that I tell them than waiting for them to find out from someone else.”).



# Relationships

## Handling Emotions during Interactions

>How you handle an interaction goes a long way toward influencing the outcome. Being able to hear someone out is a demonstration of your commitment to him or her.


1. Classifying the part you play in an interaction helps create a behavioral script that you can follow, including how you handle your emotions.
2. Using mindful acceptance strategies, you can notice and feel your reactions, but that having these feelings does not mean that you are obligated to act on them. It is often helpful to focus on your breathing and to make an effort to keep your muscles relaxed, such as allowing your arms to dangle loosely at your side. Empathy behaviors and statements can be used throughout the interaction to help you focus on what is being said.
3. some time after the interaction contemplate what you heard

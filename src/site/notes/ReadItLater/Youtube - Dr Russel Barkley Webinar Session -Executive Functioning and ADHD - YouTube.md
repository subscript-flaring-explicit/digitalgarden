# frontal-striatal circuit
- cool or what EF network
- freedom from distraction
- working memory
- organisation
- planning
- The supposedly “cool” EF brain networks, such as working memory, planning, problem solving, and foresight, may provide for the “what, where, and when” of goal-directed action, but it is the “hot” EF brain network (Castellanos et al., 2006; Nigg & Casey, 2005) that provides the “why” or basis for choosing to pursue that goal in the first place and the motivation that will be needed to get there.


# frontal-cerebellar circuit
- "when" network
- motor coordination
- timing circuit

# frontal-limbic circuit
- HOT or WHY network
- emotional discontrol
- motivation deficits
	- chooses what to do -> makes the final decision
- hyperactivity-impulsivity
- proneness to aggression

# Current paradox
- only 35%-50% of ADHD patients are impaired on EF psychometric tests
	- impaired means they are in the ==bottom 7%== of the population

# Executive Functions
- we can redefine them as
>action that is being deployed **toward ourselves** in order to change our behaviour and our future

## types
- self-awereness
	- meta-cognition
- inhibition
- working memory
- emotional control
- self-motivation
- planning and problem solving

## sequential development
1. self-awereness (self-directed attention)
	- attention toward ourselves
2. inhibition (self-restraint)
3. working memory (first non-verbal)
	- self-directed sensing
	- use of images in our mind about world we are using to guide ourselves
4. verbal working memory (self-speech)
	- talking to ourselves
	- initially out loud
		- within 10 years it becomes mental speech
	- used to guide ourselves
5. emotional regulation (self-directed emotions)
	- using the previous executive functions
6. motivation regulation (self-directed motivation)
7. planning and problem solving (self-directed play)


## EFs create four developmental transitions in "What is controlling behavior"

As EFs develop we will see changes of behaviour
- external information -> mental information
	- outside -> inside
- others -> self control
	- we learn to control ourselves
- temporal now -> anticipated future
	- control by current events 
	- use future to control us, we think what lies ahead
- immediate -> delayed gratification
	- what is controlling our motivation

# How does ADHD fit into Executive functions

two main domains of ADHD
- inhibition
	- impulsive dimension in ADHD
- meta-cognition
	- comprises of
		- emotional self-regulation
		- planning/problem-solving
	- inattention in ADHD

>We can see ADHD is really Executive Function Deficit Disorder

# Knowledge vs Performance

- ADHD is separating two parts of the brain
	- ==The Back== part where we store knowledge
	- ==The Front== where we use knowledge -> toward our goals

- Thus, ADHD is a disorder of performance, not skill
	- It is a problem with doing what you know, not a problem of knowing what to do
		- Where and when, not how

# Delay of executive function age in ADHD person
- a person with ADHD is about 25-40% behind others during development when it comes to Executive Functions
	- use it to lower the expectations

## Implications
- teach skills not knowledge

- change environment around the individual to compensate for their EFs deficits

- use medications
	- ⚠️long-term medication use might increase size of the brain in executive areas⚠️ - neuroprotective effects

- ⚠️Executive Functions may also be responsive to direct training, thou temporarily⚠️

- Behavioral treatment is essential to help individual function better on day-to-day basis
	- when you stop using them, patient goes back to baseline functioning
	- cues to substitute for the working memory deficits
		- signs, lists, cards, charts, posters
	- prosthetic consequences in the large time gaps between consequences
		- tokens, points (subtasks)

# How to help the patient to boost their EF
- How can we compensate for EF deficits
  
- don't rely on mental information -> Externalize it
	- put critical information needed for performance outside, using notes, lists, charts, reminders (CUES)

- externalize time
	- make them see how much time they have to do a task, and how much they have left -> make time physical

- break up lengthy tasks into many small steps
	- don't expect them to organize across months to accomplish a project
	- every step a day

- externalize sources of motivation
	- use privileges, tokens, rewards

- make problem solving manual, physical
	- don't rely on mental manipulation of information

- replenish their Executive Function resource pool
	- greater rewards and positive emotions
	- statements of self-efficacy and encouragement
	- 10 minutes breaks between tasks
	- 3+ minutes of relaxation/meditation
	- visualize the goals/rewards for their work
	- regular physical exercise
	- glucose ingestion

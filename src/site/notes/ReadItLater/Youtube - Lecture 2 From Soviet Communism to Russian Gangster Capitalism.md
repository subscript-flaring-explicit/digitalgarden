# Why did soviet union collapse


## ineffective economy
- You could buy things, there was a black market, you could buy things to some extent on the black market, but there's a ==hugely inefficient== command system that had basically ceased to function.
	- prices are set by decree
	- poor incentives to work
	- unsustainable economy has become even more unsustainable!

## containment
- ==containment worked==⚠️
	- the soviet system
	- containment - prevent their expansion and wait
		- their system won't work without expansion!


## Afghanistan
- they invaded Afghanistan
	- difficult country to invade
		- they learnt nothing from British


# Why was the collapse peaceful

  >you would think if somebody shoots an elephant it's gonna stumble around and do an awful lot of damage before it finally collapses. This elephant basically just knelt down and died.

- albert rischman
	- "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty" in 1970 #books/social-science
	- the framework he developed is a great baseis for an analysis of the collapse
		- 3 stances you can take on when company collapses
			- One is, you can leave, exit.
				- when there is low cost of exit -> shares, no commitment
			- Two is you can complain and try and get it changed, voice.
				- when there is some commitment
				- worker can't just exit -> exit cost is higher
					- joining union etc.
			- Three, you can try to fix it yourself. You believe in the cause and you want to make it better.
	- And a lot of Hirschman's analysis says that what mix of exit, voice, and loyalty people engage in is determined by the costs of those things.
		- calculate costs

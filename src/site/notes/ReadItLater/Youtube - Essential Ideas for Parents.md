- 18:00 - sustaining action toward a goal
	- failure to direct behavior forward in time
	- goals are not done

- distractions
	- cannot inhibit reaction to them
	- forgetting what you were doing before the distraction
		- working memory problem
			- essentially executive function disorder

- disorder itself is misnamed
	- it isn't just inattention
	- it is developmental self regulation disorder
		1. change behavior in a certain way
			- towards long term improvement
			- should you act this way provided the long term consequences
		2. self-directed activity

# executive functions adhd affects
- inhibition
	- event -> response
	- normally

- self-addressed mental speech
	- **mind's voice**
	- that voice is to self control

- regulate emotions
	- mind's heart
	- so they converge with your goals
		- our emotions are our motivations
	- so they are more socially acceptable

- self-motivation
	- dependent on environment
	- the bigger the failure when
		- consequences are delayed

	- why different?
		- different symptoms, but attention problems
		- processing information
		- choosing what is important and what is not
		- socially withdrawn
		- no inhibition problem, but adhd is that in the core
		- no executive deficits
	- comorbidities
		- less prone to odd and ocd

# Problem solving
- The central skill involved when reaching out for help is to handle the discomfort associated with initiating contact, which is an emotional regulation skill.
	1. As with facing other difficult tasks, a first step is ==defining in specific and behavioral terms what you need to do==, shrinking it down to its core elements
		- (e.g., “I need to contact my professor and explain the situation.”)
	2. A second step is to ==challenge the what-if thoughts and worst-case scenarios that interfere with taking action== (e.g., “What if my professor is angry with me?” or “I will be kicked out of college and my parents will never forgive me.”). Although your concerns are possible, your Defense Attorney can help you to develop a more realistic outlook about facing the situation
		- (e.g., “This is not the first time my professor has dealt with a student who did not hand in an assignment. She might respect that I reached out to her.” Or, “I might have to retake the course, but I probably will not be kicked out. My parents will probably be upset, but it is better that I tell them than waiting for them to find out from someone else.”).
